Simple plugin that shadows an available Facebook page.  

== Description ==
A simple plugin that pulls posts from a specific public Facebook page. The plugin stores the pulled-data as new posts and if there is any images in the original posts the plugin will take the images and upload them to the servers media. In a way one could say that the plugin is shadowing the specified Facebook-page. 
To be able to re-pull any posts, the old posts must be completely removed from the site(even from the trashcan).
The plugin is also translation ready and already translated to Swedish and English.


== Installation ==

1.Just install the plugin
2.Go to the plugin menu page at the admin page(SS options). 
3.Fill in your Facebook application-id(you have to create an application,google it) 
4.Fill in your Facebook application-secret
5.Fill in the desired facebook page name (it must be a name for an existing page ex: natgeowild) 
6.Check in what the plugin should pull 
7.Specify the update interval(requires that the plugin is deactivated and activated again)  
8.Press update settings (!important wait for the save to complete) 
9.Happy ending everyone laughs.
